#Telegram Bot

This is still a work in progress, and is currently a simple bot that can return me random pictures of cats, dogs, rabbits, and 'Magic the Gathering' cards when I want it to. Just a few of my favorite things in life to perk me up :). I run an instance of the code on my phone using Pydroid3 (Android Python IDE) and voila, the bot works as long as the instance is minimized and active. I'm still looking for ways to host the bot on a web/cloud server. Definitely am looking to add more functionalities into this bot over time, such as daily news, sports and weather updates and more, so stay tuned!
